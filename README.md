# gmap_exporter

- Export Google Maps saved lists / favorites to various portable formats. Sorely missing in Google Maps.
- Limit is 500 positions.
- Experiment with Bolt & CP etc for FE code.
- The actual back-end parser & exporter is TS CF, not in this repo yet.

- todo: beyond CSV, maybe some direct Excel-formats? https://docs.sheetjs.com/
